# Dominant vs. Secondary Separation Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the dominant vs. secondary separation check in the ThemeEngine to ensure clear differentiation between dominant and secondary colors through hue or value differences.

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Core Functions Added to `lib/roller_theme/theme_engine.dart`**

#### `_identifyDominantSecondary(List<Paint> palette)`
- Identifies dominant and secondary colors from the palette
- Filters to mid-tone "body" colors (L between 25-75) suitable for dominant/secondary roles
- Falls back to first two paints if insufficient mid-tones
- Sorts by L value and selects representative colors from different L ranges

#### `_dominantSecondarySeparation(List<Paint> palette)`
- Calculates separation score between dominant and secondary colors
- Evaluates both L (lightness) and H (hue) differences
- **Scoring Logic:**
  - Score 1.0 if ΔL ≥ 8 or ΔH ≥ 25°
  - Score 0.0 if both ΔL < 5 and ΔH < 12°
  - Linear interpolation for intermediate cases
  - Returns maximum of L or H separation scores

### 2. **Integration into Scoring System**
- Added `dominantSecondarySeparation` to the weighted scoring in `scorePalette()`
- Included in fallback average calculation (now 14 features instead of 13)
- Added to diagnostic output in `explain()` function

### 3. **Weight Configuration**
The feature can be controlled via `ThemeSpec.weights`:
```dart
final spec = ThemeSpec(
  weights: {
    'dominantSecondarySeparation': 0.8, // Adjust weight as needed
  },
);
```

## Test Results

### Separation Calculation Logic Validation:
- **Good L separation** (ΔL = 20, ΔH = 0) → Score: 1.000 ✓
- **Good H separation** (ΔL = 0, ΔH = 30) → Score: 1.000 ✓
- **Poor separation** (ΔL = 3, ΔH = 8) → Score: 0.000 ✓
- **Moderate L separation** (ΔL = 6, ΔH = 10) → Score: 0.333 ✓
- **Moderate H separation** (ΔL = 2, ΔH = 18) → Score: 0.462 ✓
- **Edge case** (ΔL = 8, ΔH = 25) → Score: 1.000 ✓

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ **Clear difference enforcement**: The system scores 1.0 for palettes with ΔL ≥ 8 or ΔH ≥ 25°

✅ **Penalization of similar colors**: Palettes where both ΔL < 5 and ΔH < 12° receive score 0.0

✅ **Smooth scoring gradient**: Linear interpolation provides fair scoring for intermediate cases

✅ **Weight configuration**: The feature is fully integrated with the existing weights system

✅ **Fallback inclusion**: Feature is included in the fallback average when no weights are provided

✅ **Lower threshold compliance**: Palettes with poor dominant/secondary separation receive lower scores and are less likely to pass the selection threshold

## Usage in Theme Generation

The feature will automatically:
1. Identify the most suitable dominant and secondary colors from each palette
2. Calculate their separation in both lightness and hue dimensions
3. Apply appropriate scoring based on blueprint requirements
4. Contribute to overall palette ranking and selection

This ensures that selected palettes have clear visual hierarchy and distinction between primary design elements, improving overall theme quality and usability.

## Files Modified
- `lib/roller_theme/theme_engine.dart` - Core implementation
- `test_separation_simple.dart` - Validation test (created)
- `test_dominant_secondary_separation.dart` - Integration test (created)

The implementation is complete, tested, and ready for production use.
